<!-- [NOTES] -->
After a few days of diving, we finally succeeded in breaking into the encirclement of the enemy, and in the establishment of a secret stronghold. The next task is to destroy.Earlier last night, with a friendly fighter was shot down in <a href = "marker:UnknowMark">Fb46</a> area on the way to perform the task. No other nearby reinforcements. I don't know if I want to see if there are any survivors. I believe it's hard for me. It's getting late, I have to start my action before the enemy stronghold is set on the ground......
